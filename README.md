# Boston-Neighborhood
Project revolves around the dynamic field of real estate analytics in the Boston area. The primary objective is to glean valuable insights from property data through meticulous analysis and innovative approaches. My project distinguishes itself by incorporating a survey and employing an innovative approach using the Extra Trees Regressor. This technique harnesses binary trees to impute missing data values, thereby enhancing the robustness of our analysis.
